The designer carries out its work in text files and he can use different tags. Div does not provide for the design obtrusive code. All that is programmed in the templates has a single goal: design.

- Replace tags
- Apply [variable's modifiers](https://divengine.org/docs/div-php-template-engine/introduction/possibilities-designer#variable-modifiers): uppercase, lowercase, word count, paragraph count, string length, URL encode, convert everything to HTML entities
- Working with substrings
- Loops, iterations, cycles or repetitive parts
- Parts of templates displayed conditionally
- Evaluation conditions
- Definition of variables
- Divide the design into parts and then include or pre-process it
- Formatting Numbers and Dates
- Working with Formulas
- Comments
- Position of content
- Recursion: the engine processes the template over and over again until there is nothing to process
- Mechanism for the inheritance among templates
- Ignoring parts of the template
- Access to any specific value of the information passed by the programmer
- Access to methods of information's objects
- Aggregate functions: sum, average, minimum, maximum, count on.
- Clean the output
- Convert HTML to readable text
- Using the custom [subparsers](https://divengine.org/docs/div-php-template-engine/introduction/possibilities-designer#subparsers) implemented by the programmer.
